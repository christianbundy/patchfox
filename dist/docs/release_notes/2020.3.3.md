# Release 2020.3.3

* **MessageDropdown:** fixing layout for the dropdown menu.
* **README:** fixed build instructions.
* **Custom URLs:** Custom URLs are back but they changed format. The new routines are using [ssb-custom-uri](https://git.sr.ht/~soapdog/ssb-custom-uri).
  * I've also added `ext+patchfox:` as a custom protocol schema. This way, other apps and extensions can launch Patchfox if they want.
* **VoteCounter:** new component to count votes on a message âœ¨.
* **Post:** 
  * Added `@mentions` to compose window.
  * Added `<VoteCounter>` component to card.
* **SSB:** 
  * Changing all threads to filter private msgs out. It was cute to see them among the other messages with the orange private border but I'm beginning to think this may lead to problems in the future. I'm filtering them out with a pipeline entry to `threads`.
  * Changed keyword to search SSB from omnibox to `ssb?`.
