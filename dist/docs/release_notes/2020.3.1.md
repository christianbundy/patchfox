# Release 2020.3.1

* **SSB:** Fixed bug with `pull.take(limit)` being fed a string from prefs.
* **Core:** SSB Client instantiation no longer depends on hardcoded manifest.
* **Browser Action:**
  * Added Sourcehut item so that people who don't want to use Github have another option.
  * Added version number to header.
  * Fixes to shortcuts including `c` for _compose new post_ and `f` for going to own profile.
* **Calendar:** limited the _Future Events_ view so that it shows events only up to two years ahead.
