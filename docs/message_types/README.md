# Secure Scuttlebutt Message Types

A [Scuttlebutt feed](https://ssbc.github.io/scuttlebutt-protocol-guide/#feeds) is a list of all the messages posted by a particular identity. When a user writes a message in a Scuttlebutt client and posts it, that message is put onto the end of their feed.

Each [message](https://ssbc.github.io/scuttlebutt-protocol-guide/#message-format) has its own _type_ which identifies what kind of message it is. There are messages related to your social graph, private messages, chess playing messages, etc. People can define their own message types provided they follow [the message format mentioned above](https://ssbc.github.io/scuttlebutt-protocol-guide/#message-format).
