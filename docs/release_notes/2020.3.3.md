# Release 2020.3.3

* **MessageDropdown:** fixing layout for the dropdown menu.
* **README:** fixed build instructions.
* **Post:** Added `@mentions` to compose window.
* **SSB:** Changing all threads to filter private msgs out. It was cute to see them among the other messages with the orange private border but I'm beginning to think this may lead to problems in the future. I'm filtering them out with a pipeline entry to `threads`.
